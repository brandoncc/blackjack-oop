How to play, Vegas (Shoe Game) rules (courtesy of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWdPf21v5Ak)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk up to table
Dealer greet player

Player's turn

Buy chips
Place bet between table min and max (cannot change after first card comes out)
Player is dealt two cards
Dealer is dealt one card face down and one card face up
If dealer or play > 21, they busted
If player or dealer has an ace and a 4, it is a soft 15, because it can be 5 or 15
If player or dealer has a hand where receiving a 10 will bust, it is a "hard" hand
If players first two cards equal 17-21, you want to stay
If players first two cards equal 2-16, you want to hit
If your first two cards equal 9-11, you may double down (add bet of equal of lesser value to current bet),
  you will only receive one card
You may also double down on a hard 12 or higher, but it is not recommended
If you win double down, you are paid for both bets, if you lose, you lose both bets
If your first two cards have the same face value, you may split (put the same value
  as your original bet on each card, and play them as separate hands)
If your next card is the same value, you may split again. You may split up to 3 times,
  for a total of 4 hands
Player may double down on split hands as well (depending on casino)
Most casinos, a split Ace receives only one more card
Blackjack is only achieved on first two cards.  After that, you have 21.
On your first two cards, you may surrender.  Surrender means forfeit the hand, but lose only half the bet.
If dealer has blackjack, surrender is denied.

Dealer's turn

Must hit on 16 or lower, over 21 busts

Comparing hands

Closer to 21 wins hand
If player wins, they receive bet paid 1:1.  If they lose, they lose the bet.
If ==, the bet stays on the table

Blackjack

Payout is 3:2, so player receives 1.5x original bet

If dealer and player both have blackjack, it is a push

Insurance

If dealer has an Ace showing, they offer insurance.
  Insurance is a side bet that player can bet if they think dealer has blackjack
Insurance bet can be up to half of original bet.

If dealer has blackjack, you keep your side bet as well as your original bet.
  If not, you lose your side bet.

If you have blackjack AND the dealer is showing an ace (and you believe dealer has blackjack),
  ask for even money instead of insurance.
The bonus you received for blackjack goes to pay the insurance, while you receive even money (1:1) on your bet

If ins/even money not taken, and both have blackjack...hand is a push.
